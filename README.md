# Sail

Sail is an online tool built for helping music-lovers browse different genres to explore sounds they like from SoundCloud.
This app follows an MVC pattern and stores data inside a NoSQL database.

Sail is built with google products Angular and Firebase!

#Usage

To see a working demo online, visit http://sail-soundcloud.herokuapp.com/

If you are a new user, you will be asked to register. After doing so you will be able to browse the app which is divided up into two main parts.

#Explore

In the Explore view, you may browse through several genres and search for sounds.
Once a sound appears, you can play it by double-clicking. To pause, simply click the pause button that will appear.

Tracks can be saved for future reference by clicking the Save link from the Explore view.

#Tracks

In the tracks view you are able to view all your saved tracks. You can store as many tracks you like here and you can remove them by clicking the delete link.
